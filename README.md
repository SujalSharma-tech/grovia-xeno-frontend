## Overview

Xeno (Grovia CRM) is a customer relationship management platform designed to help businesses manage customer data, segment their audience, execute targeted campaigns, and gain valuable insights through AI-powered analytics. The platform provides a robust foundation for marketing automation and customer engagement.

## System Architecture

Xeno is built using a modern, microservices-oriented architecture with event-driven components for scalability and resilience:

### Core Architectural Components

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - React-based SPA with component-driven UI
   - Zustand for state management (lightweight alternative to Redux)
   - Routing with React Router
   - UI components using a custom design system

2. **API Layer**
   - Express.js REST API backend
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)

3. **Processing Layer**
   - Kafka message broker for asynchronous processing
   - Multiple consumer services for dedicated workloads
   - Event-driven architecture for reliability

4. **Data Layer**
   - MongoDB for primary data storage
   - Mongoose ODM for data modeling
   - Indexing strategies for performance optimization

5. **Integration Layer**
   - Google AI (Gemini) for insights and recommendations
   - Google OAuth for social authentication

### Message Flow Architecture

The platform uses Kafka to handle asynchronous processing for intensive operations:

- **Producer Services**: Generate events for various operations
- **Consumer Services**: Process events in parallel without blocking API responses
- **Topics**: Segregated by domain (campaigns, segments, activities, insights)

## Data Models & Relationships

1. **Users & Organizations**
   - Multi-tenant architecture with organization isolation
   - Hierarchical user relationships within organizations
   - Role-based permissions (admin, editor, viewer)

2. **Customer Data Model**
   - Core entity with flexible attribute storage
   - Behavioral and transactional metrics
   - Relationship mapping to organizations

3. **Segmentation Model**
   - Rule-based segmentation engine
   - Compound conditional logic
   - Real-time preview capabilities

4. **Campaign Model**
   - Content and delivery configuration
   - Targeting parameters
   - Performance metrics and analytics

5. **Activity Tracking**
   - Comprehensive audit logs
   - User activity attribution
   - System-wide event recording
